## 🎯 Priority Breakdown

### 🔴 High Priority (Should Build Next)
1. ❌ Targeting Lab
2. ❌ Positioning Studio
3. ❌ Product Strategy Lab

## 💡 Recommendations

### If You Have 1-2 Hours:
**Build 1 Lab** → Choose either Targeting Lab or Positioning Studio (most important conceptually)

### If You Have 3-5 Hours:
**Build All 5 Labs** → Complete the entire lab suite (Targeting, Positioning, Product, Pricing, Promotion)

### If You Have 6+ Hours:
**Build Labs + Profile + Analytics** → Complete learning experience + student tracking

### If You Want to Polish:
**Enhance Dashboard + Add More Theory Content** → Make existing features better before adding new ones
