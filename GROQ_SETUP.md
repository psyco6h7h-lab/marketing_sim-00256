**"API key not found" error?**
- Make sure the file is named exactly `.env` (with the dot)
- Make sure it's in the root folder (next to package.json)
- Restart the dev server after creating .env

**Still not working?**
- Check console for errors (F12)
- Make sure your API key is valid
- Try regenerating a new API key from Groq console
