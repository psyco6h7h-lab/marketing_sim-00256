## 🎭 Buyer Personalities Now Enhanced

With Groq/Llama 3.1, each personality is MORE realistic:

1. **The Skeptic** 🤨 - Questions everything with attitude
2. **The Researcher** 📊 - Compares to real competitors
3. **Budget Buyer** 💰 - Constantly brings up price
4. **Quality Seeker** ⭐ - Demands premium proof
5. **The Impulsive** ⚡ - Gets excited, decides fast
6. **The Technical** 🔬 - Asks detailed specs
7. **The Silent Type** 🤐 - Brief but responsive

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not found"
- Make sure `.env` file exists in root folder
- Restart dev server after creating `.env`

### "Cannot read properties of undefined"
- This was the OLD bug with Gemini
- Should be completely fixed with Groq
- If you still see it, check your API key is valid

### AI not responding
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify API key in `.env` file
- Make sure you restarted the server

## 📊 Technical Details

### Models Used:
- **Chat:** `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fastest Llama model)
- **Temperature:** 0.9 (natural variety)
- **Max tokens:** 150 for chat, 500 for evaluation

### API Changes:
```typescript
// OLD (Gemini):
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({...});
const text = response.text.trim();

// NEW (Groq):
const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({...});
const text = response.choices[0].message.content.trim();
```

### Error Handling:
- Response validation before `.trim()`
- Markdown cleanup for JSON (`\`\`\`json` removal)
- Field validation for evaluation object
- Personality-specific fallbacks

2. **Test the Sales Challenge** - it should be MUCH faster!
